##  General vision👨‍💻
| Description exersise | Topics covered |
|----------------------|----------------|
|Construction of a aplication for calc of area of geometric shape (Square, Circle and Rectangle) | Interface (creation of implematation in all the records) / Records (creation of characters for each geometric shape)|
---
## [Interface](https://www.datacamp.com/pt/doc/java/interface)
Create the interface for implementation the method getArea in the elements (Square, Circle and Rectangle)

## [Records](https://medium.com/@rleite.developer/desvendando-os-records-no-java-58086a729dbe)
``
1 -> Create for each geometric shape with its particularities
`` 
<br>
``
2 -> Implementing of @overide (anonymous class) 
``
<br>
``
3 - Implemening in principal class (main) =>
Creating of conditionals of implementing of records (squarem circle, rectangle) and interact with user.
Creating of methods for work with especific data of each record.
